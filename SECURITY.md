## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use GitHub's [private vulerability reporting](https://github.com/richilino/gh-workflows/security/advisories) feature with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue. If for some reason you can't report the vulerability via GitHub, please contact us via [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@trshpnd:matrix.org) This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
